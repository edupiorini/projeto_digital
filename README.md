# Projeto Digital - Projeto Integrador 2021.2
## Biometric Access Using DY50 and Arduino UNO

This is a simple project created for the course of Computer Engineering Barchelors at UNIVESP  and will be maintained over time.

### What do you need?
* Adafruit DY50 Fingerprint Sensor
* Adafruit Library
* Arduino UNO, Mega or any other compatible microcontroller or microcomputer such as Raspberry Pi
* Jumpers
* Willpower

### Adafruit Library
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library

### How can I use it?
First of all, use your imagination! Then you can clone this project repo into your local machine, test it and implement it the way you wish.

### Here you will find:
* Register Fingerprint
* Check Fingerprint ( this one in special you can use to grant access in any sort)
* Show number of stored fingerprints
* Delete specific fingerprint
* Empty fingerprint Database

### I found an issue, what can I do?
If you find any issue contact me or you are free to fix it and pull request

### Can I collaborate?

Of course my friend? Just do it!
